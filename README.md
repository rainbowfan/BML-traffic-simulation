## herry Blossom race results data exploration and analysis is one of my projects in 2015 Spring STA 242 Statistical Programming course at UC Davis.

##About the data
The data are results from the Cherry Blossom 10-mile running race, http://cherryblossom.org/. We have these separately for women and men, for years 1999 through 2010. 

##About the analysis
The analysis focuses on exploratory data analysis and summarizing the major interesting aspects of the data. Reading semi-structured text files into R is an very important part of this project.
